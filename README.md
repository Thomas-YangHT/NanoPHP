NanoPHP
=======

NanoPHP framework is a simple PHP5 MVC framework with just core functionalities. Nanophp provides you with the least features you need to write simple yet powerful web/cli applications.
The idea is to remove all the overheads and headaches of complicated libraries, and subsitute them with simple frequent code frames.
